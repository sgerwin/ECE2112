# PA 1 - Introduction to Python Programming

To create a Python script/code in the Jupyter Notebook to do the given problems.

## Description/Given Problems

1. ALPHABET SOUP PROBLEM
   - Create a function that takes a string and returns a string with its lettersin alphabetical order.
      Example: alphabet_soup(“hello”) ➞ ehllo
               alphabet_soup(“hacker”) ➞ acehkr
2. EMOTICON PROBLEM
   - EMOTICON PROBLEM: Create a function that changes specific words into emoticons. Given a sentence as a string, replace the words smile, grin, sad and mad

     Example:
     emotify(“Make me smile”) ➞ Make me :)
     emotify(“I am mad”) ➞ I am >:(
3. UNPACKING LIST PROBLEM
   - Unpack the list writeyourcodehere into three variables, being first, middle, and last, with middle being everything in between the first and last element.
     Then print all three variables.
     
     Example: lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
     Output: first: 1 middle: [2,3,4,5] last: 6
